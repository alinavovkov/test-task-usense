## description</br>
A web application for browsing news using NewsAPI was implemented by me. The application includes:</br>

- keyword search to find relevant news articles</br>
- filtering by authors to display news from specific sources</br>
- sorting by date to show the latest updates first</br>
- article details view for more in-depth reading</br>
This functionality ensures a user-friendly experience for exploring the latest news. </br>

## Also I prepared a short detailed [video](https://www.loom.com/share/b33407523dd14a1abcda12ae5c17f288?sid=06760eca-298e-4d3b-a615-e5ec25d8ccb4)

The GitPages was impossible to implement in project and the reason is that NewsApi have such rule for free plan 
> "If you pay for NewsAPI, it might allow frontend access.".<br/>
